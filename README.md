# Congo Mines Front End Templates

Repo to store front-end templates for the rebuild of the CongoMines project.  These templates will likely be encorporated into the rails app, when it is ready for deployment.

To run locally, make sure you have [bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed and run the following command from within the project directory:

`bundle exec jekyll serve -w --baseurl ''`
